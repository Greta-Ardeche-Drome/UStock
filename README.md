## Database Structure

The project relies on a relational database. The complete SQL structure is available in [`ustock_structure.sql`](./ustock_structure.sql).

Example tables:

- `users`: stores authentication and user profile information, including fields like first_name, last_name, email, username, birth_date, gender, password_hash, and profile_image_url. The primary key id uniquely identifies each user.
- `products`: centralizes product information retrieved from Open Food Facts, with attributes such as barcode (unique key), product_name, brand, content_size, nutriscore, and image_url. This table avoids duplicating product data across users.
- `stocks`: defines the relationship between users and products with fields like quantity, expiration_date, and added_at. Each entry corresponds to a specific product in a user's inventory along with its expiration date.
- `product_consumption`: logs consumption history with product_id, user_id, quantity, status (consumed/wasted), expiration_date, and consumption_date. This table supports statistical analysis of food waste.
- `families`: groups accounts for the family mode.
